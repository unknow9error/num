# Changelog

## 0.1.1 - 2026-06-07

### Added

- Structured runtime connector errors with stable `code`, `message`, and
  `retryable` fields.
- Machine-readable `runtime_error.connector` payloads in `num run --json` and
  `num debug --json`.
- Silent JSON stdout for runtime reporting commands: `run --json`, `trace`,
  `debug --json`, and `cost-report --json`.
- `lockfile_schema` in `num version` text and JSON output.

### Changed

- Process connector timeout, invalid JSON, non-zero exit, and process lifecycle
  failures are classified as structured runtime errors.
- `num version` is now the public version surface for CLI, language, manifest
  schema, and lockfile schema contracts.

### Compatibility

- `0.1.0` manifests using `compatibility = "minor"` remain compatible with the
  `0.1.1` CLI.
- Manifest schema stays at `1`.
- Lockfile schema stays at `1`.
